> Task :app:compressReleaseAssets
Execution optimizations have been disabled for task ':app:compressReleaseAssets' to ensure correctness due to the following reasons:
  - Gradle detected a problem with the following location: '/home/hassan/Downloads/Amhawy/android/app/build/intermediates/assets/release/mergeReleaseAssets'. Reason: Task ':app:compressReleaseAssets' uses this output of task ':app:copyReleaseBundledJs' without declaring an explicit or implicit dependency. This can lead to incorrect results being produced, depending on what order the tasks are executed. Please refer to https://docs.gradle.org/7.5.1/userguide/validation_problems.html#implicit_dependency for more details about this problem.

Deprecated Gradle features were used in this build, making it incompatible with Gradle 8.0.

You can use '--warning-mode all' to show the individual deprecation warnings and determine if they come from your own scripts or plugins.

See https://docs.gradle.org/7.5.1/userguide/command_line_interface.html#sec:command_line_warnings

Execution optimizations have been disabled for 2 invalid unit(s) of work during this build to ensure correctness.
